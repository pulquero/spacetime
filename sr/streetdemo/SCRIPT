SCRIPT of the automated demo
----------------------------

[Logo is shown: Special Relativity? Spacetime? Choose what you want to
show. Credits: "libsrel (c) 2000, 2001 Mark Hale", "Demo by Mark Hale
and Bruno Barberi Gnecco", emails. After a couple seconds, the title is
severely distorted by relativity, and the image fades away.]

[A street, with some buildings, not too high (no more than 5 floors).
The street is short, just connecting two other orthogonal streets
(avoiding horizon problems). On the street, a red car is going in
one direction, and a blue car in the other direction. A man (if
possible, looking like Einstein) is waiting to cross the road, 
just beside a street sign. There are a few street signs on the 
street. A small plane (or large bird?) is flying above the cars.]

[Everything is paused. Camera is in the beginning of the street and
from this point of view can see all the objects.]

Legend: This is a common scene which you find everyday.

[cars start to move, man to walk street, bird flies.]
[Loud sound. A thump? Everything pauses again.]

Legend [big]: But not TODAY.

[View is again the same as the one at the beginning. Doppler is set to 
off.]

Legend: Today light speed will be changed: it will be only 100km/h.
Legend: The blue car is moving at 60km/h, and so is the red car. The
   man is walking at 10 km/h. And our bird is a very special one,
   because it's flying at 90 km/h.

[Scene changes to relativistic, and objects start to move, just like
in the previous shot (camera is still wrt the street). A display with our
speed, in relation to the street is present from now on.]

Legend: Quite different, ahn? Let's see the same scene from the red
   car.
[Camera instaneously moves to inside the red car. Animation continues
for a while.]

Legend: But our walking man does not see the street like this!
[Same scene, viewed from Einstein's point of view.]

Legend: And our bird sees something else.
[Same scene, viewed from the bird's point of view.]

Legend: Yet, this is not what they are really seeing. Relativity 
   affects light's frequency!
[Same scenes, rendered one after another, with doppler now]

Legend: Now let's suppose we are inside the blue car, which is stopped,
   and accelerate.

[Scene is reseted to default, and blue car starts to accelerate. 
Perhaps a non-linear acceleration would be better, fast at first,
slower later.]
